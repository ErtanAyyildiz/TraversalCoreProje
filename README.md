Traversal Project

This is showcasing the use of .NET Core 5.0, N-Tier Architecture, SignalR, Identity Server, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a web application using a combination of technologies and architectural patterns. It provides a foundation for building robust, scalable, and secure applications.

Features
N-Tier Architecture: The project follows the N-Tier architecture, which separates the application into multiple layers, including presentation, business logic, and data access. This architectural pattern improves modularity, maintainability, and testability.

SignalR: The project integrates SignalR, a real-time communication library, to enable bi-directional communication between the client and server. This allows for real-time updates and notifications in the application.

Identity Server: The project incorporates Identity Server, an open-source authentication and authorization framework, to handle user authentication and authorization. Identity Server provides a secure and centralized way to manage user identities, enabling features such as single sign-on and token-based authentication.

Ajax: The project utilizes Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to enable asynchronous communication between the client and server. Ajax allows for seamless and efficient data retrieval and updates without requiring a full page refresh.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface and implementing client-side interactivity. HTML provides the structure of the web pages, CSS enhances the visual styling, and JavaScript adds dynamic behavior to the application.
